## OGUILEM

A graphical interface for easy OGOLEM setups

Because ogolem is very prohibitive in its initial setup of calculations, my idea here is to simplify the process by
making the construction of inputs intuitive and accessible.

# Installation

Requires:

* PyQT5
* python3-pip

To install, simply clone the git repo, cd inside and do
>pip3 install --user

To run the program, do
>python3 -m oguilem
